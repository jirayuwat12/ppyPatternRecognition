# ppyPatternRecognition
**[Should read this in github]**

This is a library about AI model. All the model ideas are come from inclass lecture.

You can see the class github [here](https://github.com/ekapolc/Pattern_2024) which is created by Aj. Ekapol.

## Provided model
- [K-nearest neighbor](#K-nearst-neighbor)
- [Linear regression](#Linear-regression)

## How to install
1. Install python
1. Install library using `pip`
    ```bash
    pip install -U ppyPatternRecognition
    ```

## K-nearst neighbor
code [here](./ppyPatternRecognition/knn.py)

example
```python
from ppyPatternRecognition import KNN

df = pd.read_csv(...)

knn = KNN()

# fit the model
labeled_df = knn.fit(df, k=3)

# print the label
print(labeled_df['label'])

# get the last centroid
print(knn.last_centroid)
```
- `fit` method will return the dataframe with label column
- `last_centroid` is the last centroid of the model after fitting


## Linear regression
